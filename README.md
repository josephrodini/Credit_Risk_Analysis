# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Using supervised machine learning to assess credit risk

## Overview of Analysis

### Examining Credit Risk

This project was undertaken in order to evaluate the granting of loans, with the goal of predicting credit risk. Credit risk is inherently unbalanced, with good loans outnumbering risky ones. Therefore, within the domain of supervised machine learning, various models were built to evaluate the data using resampling.

### Resources

- Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
- Technology: Jupyter Notebook, Python, scikit-learn library, imbalanced-learn library

## Results

### Data

A CSV file of loan information was obtained for analysis. See below for a snapshot of the dataframe. As expected, the number of low-risk loans vastly outnumbered the risky loans by a tally of 68470 to 347.
