# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Using supervised machine learning to assess credit risk

## Overview of Analysis

### Examining Credit Risk

This project was undertaken in order to evaluate the granting of loans, with the goal of predicting credit risk. Credit risk is inherently unbalanced, with good loans outnumbering risky ones. Therefore, within the domain of supervised machine learning, various models were built to evaluate the data using resampling.
